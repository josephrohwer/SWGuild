				HuHot Mongolian Grills, LLC opened its first restaurant in Missoula, MT in 1999.
				It was a short time later in 2002 that the first franchisee opened a store in Omaha, NE.
				Now, the fastest growing Mongolian grill concept in the United States is moving forward with full force. 
				Business strategies include focus on internal business operational optimization & differentiated growth 
				by emphasizing fast, fresh, healthy, customer-oriented full service restaurants. <br><br>

				HuHot is a bold, exciting oasis in a desert of boring restaurant concepts. Our branding efforts mirror 
				Genghis Khan’s attitude toward the world… ripe for conquest. Like Genghis Khan viewed rival nations, we 
				also look at our competition with confident disdain. These themes are carried throughout all of our 
				marketing and are included in our in-store materials. Adults and kids alike find themselves caught up 
				in the excitement with each visit to HuHot.
